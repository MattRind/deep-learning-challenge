# deep-learning-challenge
1. **Overview** of the analysis: To create a tool that will help the nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup select applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures. In this case the tool uses a binary classifier as part of a machine learning and neural network model, and the source of data is from more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup.

2. **Results:** 

* Data Preprocessing

  - The variable that was assigned as the target in the neural network model was 'IS_SUCCESSFUL'. 
  - What variable(s) are the features for your model?
  - The variables that were removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features were two identification fields of data 'EIN' and 'NAME'. As explained in the summary, 'STATUS' and 'SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS' could be removed in further neural network modeling.

* Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

There were a grand total of 4 models complied, trained and evaluated. In the original model,  How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?

3. **Summary:** Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and then explain your recommendation.
