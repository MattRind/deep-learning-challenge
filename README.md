# deep-learning-challenge
This repo contains two jupyter notebooks, two __ files and another Markdown file that is the Summary Report (in addition to this Markdown file). `AlphabetSoupCharity.ipynb` is the original neural network model and `AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization.ipynb` contains the optimized models. The models were run in Google Colab. A jupyter notebook template was originally provided, which I followed primarily for Step 1 (Preprocessing the Data) in the modeling. Step 4 (Summary Report) is `Summary_Report.md`. All new code was written by me.
