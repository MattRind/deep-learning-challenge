# deep-learning-challenge
- This repo contains two jupyter notebooks, two `.h5` files, two `.keras` files and another Markdown file that is the Summary Report (in addition to this Markdown file). 
- `AlphabetSoupCharity.ipynb` is the original neural network model and `AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization.ipynb` contains the optimized models. 
- The models were run in Google Colab. A jupyter notebook template was originally provided, which I followed primarily for Step 1 (Preprocessing the Data) in the modeling. 
- The results of the modeling - Step 4 (Summary Report) can be read in `Summary_Report.md`. 
- All new code was written by me.
